        <h3>PyCon Philippines</h3>
        <p>PyCon Philippines is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit conference centered around the Python
        Programming language.</p>
        <p>The main goal of this conference is to provide a venue where the Python programming language
        and surrounding technologies can be explored, discussed and exercised.</p>
        <p>At the same time an underlying interest would be to gather software engineers, programming
        enthusiasts, startup founders, corporate IT decision makers, students and IT educators in a
        2-day event where they can collaborate and network with each other.</p>

          <h3>PyCon PH 2012</h3>
          <p>
            The first Python Conference in the Philippines was held last June 30 to July 1 2012 in UP
            Diliman. Spearheaded by Frank and Ann Pohlmann of Auberon Solutions, it was a huge success
            in spite of a short amount of time we had for the preparation. The conference was graced
            upon representatives from the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and a turnout of roughly
            240 students and professionals across the country. It was truly an inspiring event with a
            diverse audience and a distinct spirit of volunteerism that made it happen.

        Ticket price would definitely increase after February 7 due to the need
        to rush things like t-shirt printing.  However, we may also run out of seats by
        then so it's recommended to buy the tickets early.
      </p>
